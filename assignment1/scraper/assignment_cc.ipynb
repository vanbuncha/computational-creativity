    "- Decided that those mentioned were not interesting enough\n",
    "- Chose neural networks\n",
    "- It was time to decide what kind of poems to use as inspiration\n",
    "- Remembered Charles Bukowski because of his strong and recognizable style of writing - struggle of living life\n",
    "- scraped Poem Hunter - 151 Bukowski poems - not enough (imo) so scraped some more similar authors (Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Lawrence Felinghetti and Sylvia Plath)\n",
    "- joined scraped data and cleaned it up\n",
    "- created tokenizer and fined tuned gpt2\n",
    "- then for poem generation i played around few parameters - especially giving model freedom of how long poem can be to not have abrupt end. Seed initialiation, temperature etc\n",
    "- Also seed text has big influence - can inflence the stylistical style a lot \n",
    "- poem make sense but have no sentence stoppers\n",
    "- as for evaluation i fed back poems to Chatgpt to try to guess who is the author - usually at least one of the chosen authors sometimes 3/5 or even 4/5.\n",
    "- sometimes guessed some other authors as well: William S. Burroughs, T.S. Eliot occuring a lot"
