not their death<|endoftext|>either peace or happiness let it enfold you when i was a young man i felt these things were dumb unsophisticated i had bad blood a twisted mind a precarious upbringing i was hard as granite i leered at the sun i trusted no man and especially no woman i was living a hell in small rooms i broke things smashed things walked through glass cursed i challenged everything was continually being evicted jailed in and out of fights in and out of my mind women were something to screw and rail at i had no male friends i changed jobs and cities i hated holidays babies history newspapers museums grandmothers marriage movies spiders garbagemen english accentsspain franceitalywalnuts and the color orange algebra angred me opera sickened me charlie chaplin was a fake and flowers were for pansies peace and happiness to me were signs of inferiority tenants of the weak and addled mind but as i went on with my alley fights my suicidal years my passage through any number of womenit gradually began to occur to me that i wasnt different from the others i was the same they were all fulsome with hatred glossed over with petty grievances the men i fought in alleys had hearts of stone everybody was nudging inching cheating for some insignificant advantage the lie was the weapon and the plot was empty darkness was the dictator cautiously i allowed myself to feel good at times i found moments of peace in cheap rooms just staring at the knobs of some dresser or listening to the rain in the dark the less i needed the better i felt maybe the other life had worn me down i no longer found glamour in topping somebody in conversation or in mounting the body of some poor drunken female whose life had slipped away into sorrow i could never accept life as it was i could never gobble down all its poisons but there were parts tenuous magic parts open for the asking i re formulated i dont know when date time all that but the change occurred something in me relaxed smoothed out i no longer had to prove that i was a man i didnt have to prove anything i began to see things coffee cups lined up behind a counter in a cafe or a dog walking along a sidewalk or the way the mouse on my dresser top stopped there with its body its ears its nose it was fixed a bit of life caught within itself and its eyes looked at me and they were beautiful then it was gone i began to feel good i began to feel good in the worst situations and there were plenty of those like say the boss behind his desk he is going to have to fire me ive missed too many days he is dressed in a suit necktie glasses he says i am going to have to let you go its all right i tell him he must do what he must do he has a wife a house children expenses most probably a girlfriend i am sorry for him he is caught i walk onto the blazing sunshine the whole day is mine temporarily anyhow the whole world is at the throat of the world everybody feels angry shortchanged cheated everybody is despondent disillusioned i welcomed shots of peace tattered shards of happiness i embraced that stuff like the hottest number like high heels breasts singingthe works dont get me wrong there is such a thing as cockeyed optimism that overlooks all basic problems just for the sake of itself this is a shield and a sickness the knife got near my throat again i almost turned on the gas again but when the good moments arrived again i didnt fight them off like an alley adversary i let them take me i luxuriated in them i made them welcome home i even looked into the mirror once having thought myself to be ugly i now liked what i saw almost handsome yes a bit ripped and ragged scares lumps odd turns but all in all not too bad almost handsome better at least than some of those movie star faces like the cheeks of a babys butt and finally i discovered real feelings of others unheralded like lately like this morning as i was leaving for the track i saw my wife in bed just the shape of her head there not forgetting centuries of the living and the dead and the dying the pyramids mozart dead but his music still there in the room weeds growing the earth turning the tote board waiting for me i saw the shape of my wifes head she so still i ached for her life just being there under the covers i kissed her in the forehead got down the stairway got outside got into my marvelous car fixed the seatbelt backed out the drive feeling warm to the fingertips down to my foot on the gas pedal i entered the world once more drove down the hill past the houses full and empty of people i saw the mailman honked

believe it but there are people who go through life with very little friction or distress they dress well eat well sleep well they are contented with their family life they have moments of grief but all in all they are undisturbed and often feel very good and when they die it is an easy death usually in their sleep you may not believe it but such people do exist but i am not one of them oh no i am not one of them i am not even near to being one of them but they are there and i am here<|endoftext|>during my worst times on the park benches in the jails or living with whores i always had this

crushing of the light and the way its not quite right its hardly right at all he said dont i know it i answered i walked away from the mirror it was morning it was afternoon it was night nothing changed it was locked in place something flashed something broke something remained i walked down the stairway and into it submitted by tom<|endoftext|>call it the greenhouse effect or whatever but it just doesnt rain like it used to i particularly remember the rains of the depression era there wasnt any money but there was plenty of rain it wouldnt rain for just a night or a day it would rain for days and nights and in los angeles the storm drains werent built to carry off taht much water and the rain came down thick and mean and steady and you heard it banging against the roofs and into the ground waterfalls of it came down from roofs and there was hail big rocks of ice bombing exploding smashing into things and the rain just wouldnt stop and all the roofs leaked dishpans cooking pots were placed all about they dripped loudly and had to be emptied again and again the rain came up over the street curbings across the lawns climbed up the steps and entered the houses there were mops and bathroom towels and the rain often came up through the toiletsbubbling brown crazywhirling and all the old cars stood in the streets cars that had problems starting on a sunny day and the jobless men stood looking out the windows at the old machines dying like living things out there the jobless men failures in a failing time were imprisoned in their houses with their wives and children and their pets the pets refused to go out and left their waste in strange places the jobless men went mad confined with their once beautiful wives there were terrible arguments as notices of foreclosure fell into the mailbox rain and hail cans of beans bread without butter fried eggs boiled eggs poached eggs peanut butter sandwiches and an invisible chicken in every pot my father never a good man at best beat my mother when it rained as i threw myself between them the legs the knees the screams until they seperated ill kill you i screamed at him you hit her again and ill kill you get that sonofabitching kid out of here no henry you stay with your mother all the households were under seige but i believe that ours held more terror than the average and at night as we attempted to sleep the rains still came down and it was in bed in the dark watching the moon against the scarred window so bravely holding out most of the rain i thought of noah and the ark and i thought it has come again we all thought that and then at once it would stop and it always seemed to stop around or am peaceful then but not an exact silence because things continued to drip drip drip and there was no smog then and by am there was a blazing yellow sunlight van gogh yellow crazy blinding and then the roof drains relieved of the rush of water began to expand in the warmth pang pang pang and everybody got up and looked outside and there were all the lawns still soaked greener than green will ever be and there were birds on the lawn chirping like mad they hadnt eaten decently for days and nights and they were weary of berries and they waited as the worms rose to the top half drowned worms the birds plucked them up and gobbled them down there were blackbirds and sparrows the blackbirds tried to drive the sparrows off but the sparrows maddened with hunger smaller and quicker got their due the men stood on their porches smoking cigarettes now knowing theyd have to go out there to look for that job that probably wasnt there to start that car that probably wouldnt start and the once beautiful wives stood in their bathrooms combing their hair applying makeup trying to put their world back together again trying to forget that awful sadness that gripped them wondering what they could fix for breakfast and on the radio we were told that school was now open and soon there i was on the way to school massive puddles in the street the sun like a new world my parents back in that house i arrived at my classroom on time mrs sorenson greeted us with we wont have our usual recess the grounds are too wet aw most of the boys went but we are going to do something special at recess she went on and it will be fun well we all wondered what that would be and the two hour wait seemed a long time as mrssorenson went about teaching her lessons i looked at the little girls they looked so pretty and clean and alert they sat still and straight and their hair was beautiful in the california sunshine the the recess bells rang and we all waited for the fun then mrs sorenson told us now what we are going to do is we are going to tell each other what we did during the rainstorm well begin in the front row and go right around now michael youre first well we all began to tell our stories michael began and it went on and on and soon we realized that we were all lying not exactly lying but mostly lying and some of the boys began to snicker and some of the girls began to give them dirty looks and mrssorenson said all right i demand a modicum of silence here i am interested in what you did during the rainstorm even if you arent so we had to tell our stories and they were stories one girl said that when the rainbow first came she saw gods face at the end of it only she didnt say which end one boy said he stuck his fishing pole out the window and caught a little fish and fed it to his cat almost everybody told a lie the truth was just too awful and embarassing to tell then the bell rang and recess was over thank you said mrs sorenson that was very nice and tomorrow the grounds will be dry and we will put them to use again most of the boys cheered and the little girls sat very straight and still looking so pretty and clean and alert their hair beautiful in a sunshine that the world might never see again and<|endoftext|>i reached up into the top of the closet and took

up in my bed the llights out hearing the outside sounds lifting my cheap bottle of wine letting the warmth of the grape enter me as i heard the rats moving about the room i preferred them to humans

sundaes and sit in the car and eat them i must admit they are quite good a curious new world all my friends tell me i am looking better youre looking good man we thought you were going to die there for a while those dark nights the jails the hospitals and later that night there is use for the pecker use for love and it is glorious long and true and afterwards we speak of easy things our heads by

the jocks coming out for a middle race silent and the easy rain making everything at once almost alike the horses at peace with each other before the drunken war and i am under the grandstand feeling for cigarettes settling for coffee then the horses walk by taking their little men away it is funereal and graceful and glad like the opening of flowers<|endoftext|>they are building a house half a block down and i sit up here with the shades down listening to the sounds the hammers pounding in nails thack thack thack thack and then i hear birds and thack thack thack and i go to bed i pull the covers to my throat they have been building this house for a month and soon it will have its peoplesleeping eating loving moving around but somehow now it is not right there seems a madness men walk on top with nails in their mouths and i read about castro and cuba and at night i walk by and the ribs of the house show and inside i can see cats walking the way cats walk and then a boy rides by on a bicycle and still the house is not done and in the morning the men will be back walking around on the house with their hammers and it seems people should not build houses anymore it seems people should not get married anymore it seems people should stop working and sit in small rooms on nd floors under electric lights without shades it seems there is a lot to forget and a lot not to do and in drugstores markets bars the people are tired they do not want to move and i stand there at night and look through this house and the house does not want to be built through its sides i can see the purple hills and the first lights of evening and it is cold and i button my coat and i stand there looking through the house and the cats stop and look at me until i am embarrased and move north up

soaring store of oranges apples avocados tomatoes cucumbers and you know how these look they do look good as if you could eat them all light a cigar and smoke away the bad world then its best to go back to the bars the same bars wooden stale merciless green with the young policeman walking through scared and looking for trouble and the beer is still bad it has an edge that already mixes with vomit and decay and youve got to be strong in the shadows to ignore it to ignore the poor and to ignore yourself and the shopping bag between your legs down there feeling good with its avocados and oranges and fresh fish and wine bottles who needs a fort lauderdale winter years ago there used to be a whore there with a film over one eye who was too fat and made little silver bells out of

sort of snob and not very good with getting the corkscrews and ice and wine glasses up to us and he was always phoning to say the other guests objected to our noise what other guests i always told him that everything was very quiet nothing was going on that somebody must be crazy so will you please stop ringing but he kept ringing he became almost like a companion to us through the night but the day man was very nice he always had little messages of importance that either meant money or a good friend coming to see us or both we stayed at the hotel twice during our trip to europe and each time we checked out the day clerk bowed ever so slightly he was tall and welldressed and pleasant and he said each time it was nice to have you with us please come here again if you return thank you we

things at the time i suggested to the editors and the critics that he was one to be watched and also that he had hardly yet been noticed and that he certainly should now be noticed this writer used some of my remarks as blurbs for his books which i didnt mind all of his publications were little chapbooks to pages mimeographed they came out at a rapid rate perhaps three or four a year the problem was that each chapbook seemed a little weaker than the one that preceded it but he continued to use my old blurbs my wife noticed the change in his writing too whats happened to his writing she asked me hes doing too much of it hes pushing it out forcing it this stuff is bad you ought to tell him to stop using your blurbs i cant do that i just wish he wouldnt publish so much well you publish all the time too with me i told her its different yesterday i received another of his little chapbooks with his delicate dedication scrawled on the title page this latest effort was totally flat the words just fell off the page dead on arrival where had he gone too much ambition too much just doing it for the sake of doing it just not waiting for the words to pile up inside and then explode of their

the way and bade them enter an editor and a poet only one would drink a beer the editor so i drank two for the poet and one for myself and they sat there sweating and watching me and i sat there trying to explain that i wasnt really a poet in the ordinary sense i told them about the stockyards and the slaughterhouse and the racetracks and the conditions of some of our jails and the editor suddenly pulled five magazines out of a portfolio and tossed them in between the beercans and we talked about flowers of evil rimbaud villon and what some of the modern poets looked like jb may and wolf the hedley are very immaculate clean fingernails etc i apologized for the beercans my beard and everything on the floor and pretty soon everybody was yawning and the editor suddenly stood up and i said are you leaving and then the editor and the poet were walking out the door and then i thought well hell they might not have liked what they saw but im not selling beercans and italian opera and torn stockings under the bed and dirty fingernails im selling rhyme and life and line and i walked over and cracked a new can of beer and i looked at the five magazines with my name on the cover and

awhile close your eyes let your breathing stop three seconds or so listen to the inside silence in the womb of the world let your hands and nerveends drop rerecognize the bliss you forgot the emptiness and essence and ecstasy of ever having been and ever to be the golden eternity this is the lesson you forgot the lesson was taught long ago in the other world systems that have naturally changed into the empty and awake and are here now smiling in our smile and scowling in our scowl it is only like the golden eternity pretending to be smiling and scowling to itself like a ripple on

though it is everything strictly speaking there is no golden eternity because everything is nothing there are no things and no goings and comings for all is emptiness and emptiness is these forms emptiness is this one formhood all these selfnesses have already vanished einstein measured that this present universe is an expanding bubble and you know what that means discard such definite imaginations of phenomena as your own self thou human being thourt a numberless mass of sunmotes each mote a shrine the same as to your shyness of other selves selfness as divided into infinite numbers of beings or selfness as identified as one self existing eternally be obliging and noble be generous with your time and help and possessions and be kind because the emptiness of this little place of flesh you carry around and call your soul your entity is the same emptiness in every direction of space unmeasurable emptiness the same one and holy emptiness everywhere why be selfy and unfree man god in your dream wake up thourt selfless and free even and upright your mind abides nowhere states hui neng of china were all in heaven now roaring dreams take place in a perfectly silent mind now that we know this throw the raft away are you tightwad and are you mean those are the true sins and sin is only a conception of ours due to long habit are you generous and are you kind those are the true virtues and theyre only conceptions the golden eternity rests beyond sin and virtue is attached to neither is attached to nothing is unattached because the golden eternity is alone the mold has rills but it is one mold the field has curves but it is one field all things are different forms of the same thing i call it the golden eternitywhat do you call it brother for the blessing and merit of virtue and the punishment and bad fate of sin are alike just so many words sociability is a big smile and a big smile is nothing but teeth rest and be kind theres no need to deny that evil thing called googoo which doesnt exist just as theres no need to deny that evil thing called sex and rebirth which also doesnt exist as it is only a form of emptiness the bead of semen comes from a long line of awakened natures that were your parent a holy flow a succession of saviors pouring from the womb of the dark void and back into it fantastic magic imagination of the lightning flash plays dreams not even plays dreams the womb of exuberant fertility ashvhaghosha called it radiating forms out of its womb of exuberant emptiness in emptiness there is no why no knowledge of why no ignorance of why no asking and no answering of why and no significance attached to this a disturbed and frightened man is like the golden eternity experimentally pretending at feeling the disturbedandfrightened mood a calm and joyous man is like the golden eternity pretending at experimenting with that experience a man experiencing his sentient being is like the golden eternity pretending at trying that out too a man who has no thoughts is like the golden eternity pretending at being itself because the emptiness of everything has no beginning and no end and at present is infinite love is all in all said sainte therese choosing love for her vocation and pouring out her happiness from her garden by the gate with a gentle smile pouring roses on the earth so that the beggar in the thunderbolt received of the endless offering of her dark void man goes abeggaring into nothingness ignorance is the father habitenergy is the mother opposites are not the same for the same reason they are the same the words atoms of dust and the great universes are only words the idea that they imply is only an idea the belief that we live here in this existence divided into various beings passing food in and out of ourselves and casting off husks of bodies one after another with no cessation and no definite or particular discrimination is only an idea the seat of our immortal intelligence can be seen in that beating light between the eyes the wisdom eye of the ancients we know what were doing were not disturbed because were like the golden eternity pretending at playing the magic cardgame and making believe its real its a big dream a joyous ecstasy of words and ideas and flesh an ethereal flower unfolding a folding back a movie an exuberant bunch of lines bounding emptiness the womb of avalokitesvara a vast secret silence springtime in the void happy young gods talking and drinking on a cloud our chillicosms bear all the marks of excellence blind milky light fills our night and the morning is crystal give a gift to your brother but theres no gift to compare with the giving of assurance that he is the golden eternity the true understanding of this would bring tears to your eyes the other shore is right here forgive and forget protect and reassure your tormenters will be purified raise thy diamond hand have faith and wait the course of your days is a river rumbling over your rocky back youre sitting at the bottom of the world with a head of iron religion is thy sad heart youre the golden eternity and it must be done by you and means one thing nothingeverhappened this is the golden eternity when the prince of the kalinga severed the flesh from the limbs and body of buddha even then the buddha was free from any such ideas as his own self other self living beings divided into many selves or living beings united and identified into one eternal self the golden eternity isnt me before you can know that youre dreaming youll wake up atman had the buddha the awakened one cherished any of these imaginary judgments of and about things he would have fallen into impatience and hatred in his suffering instead like jesus on the cross he saw the light and died kind loving all living things the world was spun out of a blade of grass the world was spun out of a mind heaven was spun out of a blade of grass heaven was spun out of a mind neither will do you much good neither will do you much harm the oriental imperturbed is the golden eternity he is called a yogi his is called a priest a minister a brahmin a parson a chaplain a roshi a laoshih a master a patriarch a pope a spiritual commissar a counselor and adviser a bodhisattvamahasattva an old man a saint a shaman a leader who thinks nothing of himself as separate from another self not higher nor lower no stages and no definite attainments no mysterious stigmata or secret holyhood no wild dark knowledge and no venerable authoritativeness nay a giggling sage sweeping out of the kitchen with a broom after supper a silent smoke because there is no definite teaching the world is undisciplined nature endlessly in every direction inward to your body and outward into space meditate outdoors the dark trees at night are not really the dark trees at night its only the golden eternity a mosquito as big as mount everest is much bigger than you think a horses hoof is more delicate than it looks an altar consecrated to the golden eternity filled with roses and lotuses and diamonds is the cell of the humble prisoner the cell so cold and dreary boethius kissed the robe of the mother truth in a roman dungeon do you think the emptiness of the sky will ever crumble away every little child knows that everybody will go to heaven knowing that nothing ever happened is not really knowing that nothing ever happened its the golden eternity in other words nothing can compare with telling your brother and your sister that what happened what is happening and what will happen never really happened is not really happening and never will happen it is only the golden eternity nothing was ever born nothing will ever die indeed it didnt even happen that you heard about golden eternity through the accidental reading of this scripture the thing is easily false there are no warnings whatever issuing from the golden eternity do what you want even in dreams be kind because anyway there is no time no space no mind its all notborn said bankei of japan whose mother heard this from her son did what we call died happy and even if she had died unhappy dying unhappy is not really dying unhappy its the golden eternity its impossible to exist its impossible to be persecuted its impossible to miss your reward eight hundred and four thousand myriads of awakened ones throughout numberless swirls of epochs appeared to work hard to save a grain of sand and it was only the golden eternity and their combined reward will be no greater and no lesser than what will be won by a piece of dried turd its a reward beyond thought when youve understood this scripture throw it away if you cant understand this scripture throw it away i insist on your freedom o everlasting eternity all things and all truth laws are no things in three ways which is the same way as things of time they dont exist because there is no furthest atom than can be found or weighed or grasped it is emptiness through and through matter and empty space too as things of mind they dont exist because the mind that conceives and makes them out does so by seeing hearing touching smelling tasting and mentallynoticing and without this mind they would not be seen or heard or felt or smelled or tasted or mentallynoticed they are discriminated that which theyre not necessarily by imaginary judgments of the mind they are actually dependent on the mind that makes them out by themselves they are nothings they are really mental seen only of the mind they are really empty visions of the mind heaven is a vision everything is a vision what does it mean that i am in this endless universe thinking im a man sitting under the stars on the terrace of earth but actually empty and awake throughout the emptiness and awakedness of everything it means that i am empty and awake knowing that i am empty and awake and that theres no difference between me and anything else it means that i have attained to that which everything is theattainertothatwhicheverythingis the sanskrit tathagata has no ideas whatever but abides in essence identically with the essence of all things which is what it is in emptiness and silence imaginary meaning stretched to make mountains and as far as the germ is concerned it stretched even further to make molehills a million souls dropped through hell but nobody saw them or counted them a lot of large people isnt really a lot of large people its only the golden eternity when st francis went to heaven he did not add to heaven nor detract from earth locate silence possess space spot me the ego from the beginning said the sixth patriarch of the china school not a thing is he who loves all life with his pity and intelligence isnt really he who loves all life with his pity and intelligence its only natural the universe is fully known because it is ignored enlightenment comes when you dont care this is a good tree stump im sitting on you cant even grasp your own pain let alone your eternal reward i love you because youre me i love you because theres nothing else to do its just the natural golden eternity what does it mean that those trees and mountains are magic and unreal it means that those trees and mountains are magic and unreal what does it mean that those trees and mountains are not magic but real it means that those trees and mountains are not magic but real men are just making imaginary judgments both ways and all the time its just the same natural golden eternity if the golden eternity was anything other than mere words you could not have said golden eternity this means that the words are used to point at the endless nothingness of reality if the endless nothingness of reality was anything other than mere words you could not have said endless nothingness of reality you could not have said it this means that the golden eternity is out of our wordreach it refuses steadfastly to be described it runs away from us and leads us in the name is not really the name the same way you could not have said this world if this world was anything other than mere words theres nothing there but just that theyve long known that theres nothing to life but just the living of it it is what it is and thats all it is theres no system of teaching and no reward for teaching the golden eternity because nothing has happened in the golden eternity teaching and reward havent even vanished let alone appeared the golden eternity doesnt even have to be perfect it is very silly of me to talk about it i talk about it simply because here i am dreaming that i talk about it in a dream already ended ages ago from which im already awake and it was only an empty dreaming in fact nothing whatever in fact nothing ever happened at all the beauty of attaining the golden eternity is that nothing will be acquired at last kindness and sympathy understanding and encouragement these give they are better than just presents and gifts no reason in the world why not anyhow be nice remember the golden eternity is yourself if someone will simply practice kindness said gotama to subhuti he will soon attain highest perfect wisdom then he added kindness after all is only a word and it should be done on the spot without thought of kindness by practicing kindness all over with everyone you will soon come into the holy trance infinite distinctions of personalities will become what they really mysteriously are our common and eternal blissstuff the pureness of everything forever the great bright essence of mind even and one thing everywhere the holy eternal milky love the white light everywhere everything emptybliss svaha shining ready and awake the compassion in the sound of silence the swarming myriad trillionaire you are everythings alright form is emptiness and emptiness is form and were here forever in one form or another which is empty everythings alright were not here there or anywhere everythings alright cats sleep the everlasting and tranquil essence look around and see the smiling essence everywhere how wily was the world made maya notevenmade theres the world in the daylight if it was completely dark you wouldnt see it but it would still be there if you close your eyes you really see what its like mysterious particleswarming emptiness on the moon big mosquitos of straw know this in the kindness of their hearts truly speaking unrecognizably sweet it all is dont worry about nothing imaginary judgments about things in the nothingeverhappened wonderful void you dont even have to reject them let alone accept them that looks like a tree lets call it a tree said coyote to earthmaker at the beginning and they walked around the rootdrinker patting their bellies perfectly selfless the beauty of it the butterfly doesnt take it as a personal achievement he just disappears through the trees you too kind and humble and notevenhere it wasnt in a greedy mood that you saw the light that belongs to everybody look at your little finger the emptiness of it is no different than the emptiness of infinity cats yawn because they realize that theres nothing to do up in heaven you wont remember all these tricks of yours you wont even sigh why whether as atomic dust or as great cities whats the difference in all this stuff a tree is still only a rootdrinker the pumas twisted face continues to look at the blue sky with sightless eyes ah sweet divine and indescribable verdurous paradise planted in midair caitanya its only consciousness not with thoughts of your mind but in the believing sweetness of your heart you snap the link and open the golden door and disappear into the bright room the everlasting ecstasy eternal now soldier follow me there never was a war arjuna dont fight why fight over nothing bless and sit down i remember that im supposed to be a man and consciousness and i focus my eyes and the print reappears and the words of the poor book are saying the world as god has made it and there are no words in my pitying heart to express the knowless loveliness of the trance there was before i read those words i had no such idea that there was a world this world has no marks signs or evidence of existence nor the noises in it like accident of wind or voices or heehawing animals yet listen closely the eternal hush of silence goes on and on throughout all this and has been gong on and will go on and on this is because the world is nothing but a dream and is just thought of and the everlasting eternity pays no attention to it at night under the moon or in a quiet room hush now the secret music of the unborn goes on and on beyond conception awake beyond existence properly speaking awake is not really awake because the golden eternity never went to sleep you can tell by the constant sound of silence which cuts through this world like a magic diamond through the trick of your not realizing that your mind caused the world the god of the american plateau indian was coyote he says earth those beings living on your surface none of them disappearing will all be transformed when i have spoken to them when they have spoken to me from that moment on their words and their bodies which they usually use to move about with will all change i will not have heard them i was smelling flowers in the yard and when i stood up i took a deep breath and the blood all rushed to my brain and i woke up dead on my back in the grass i had apparently fainted or died for about sixty seconds my neighbor saw me but he thought i had just suddenly thrown myself on the grass to enjoy the sun during that timeless moment of unconsciousness i saw the golden eternity i saw heaven in it nothing had ever happened the events of a million years ago were just as phantom and ungraspable as the events of now or the events of the next ten minutes it was perfect the golden solitude the golden emptiness somethingor other something surely humble there was a rapturous ring of silence abiding perfectly there was no question of being alive or not being alive of likes and dislikes of near or far no question of giving or gratitude no question of mercy or judgment or of suffering or its opposite or anything it was the womb itself aloneness alaya vijnana the universal store the great free treasure the great victory infinite completion the joyful mysterious essence of arrangement it seemed like one smiling smile one adorable adoration one gracious and adorable charity everlasting safety refreshing afternoon roses infinite brilliant immaterial gold ash the golden age the golden came from the sun in my eyelids and the eternity from my sudden instant realization as i woke up that i had just been where it all came from and where it was all returning the everlasting so and so never coming or going therefore i call it the golden eternity but you can call it anything you want as i regained consciousness i felt so sorry i had a body and a mind suddenly realizing i didnt even have a body and a mind and nothing had ever happened and everything is alright forever and forever and forever o thank you thank you thank you this is the first teaching from the golden eternity the second teaching from the golden eternity is that there never was a first teaching from the golden eternity so be sure<|endoftext|>snow in my shoe abandoned sparrows nest<|endoftext|>sweet sad young

mornings after the fog burns off and the sun paints white houses with the sea light of greece with sharp clean shadows making the town look like it had just been painted but the wind comes up at four

first real live dragon ever actually to reach these shores and the great chinese dragon passing thru the golden gate spouting streams of water like a string of fireboats then broke loose somewhere near china camp gulped down a hundred chinese seamen and forthwith ate all the shrimp in san francisco bay and the great chinese dragon was therefore forever after confined in a chinatown basement and ever since allowed out only for chinese new years parades and other unamerican demonstrations paternally watchedover by those benevolent men in blue who represent our more advanced civilization which has reached such a high state of democracy as to allow even a few barbarians to carry on their quaint native customs in our midst and thus the great chinese dragon which is the greatest dragon in all the world now can only be seen creeping out of an adler alley cellar like a worm out of a hole sometime during the second week in february every year when it sorties out of hibernation in its chinese storeroom pushed from behind by a band of fortythree chinese electricians and technicians who stuff its peristaltic accordionbody up thru a sidewalk delivery entrance and first the swaying snout appears and then the eyes at ground level feeling along the curb and then the head itself casting about and swayingand heaving finally up to the corner of grant avenue itself where a huge paper sign proclaims the worlds largest chinatown and the great chinese dragons jaws wired permanently agape as if by a demented dentist to display the cadmium teeth as the hungry head heaves out into grant avenue right under the sign and raising itself with a great snort of fire suddenly proclaims the official firecracker start of the chinese new year and the lightbulb eyes lighting up and popping out on coiled wire springs and the body stretching and rocking further and further around the corner and down grant avenue like a caterpillar rollercoaster with the eyes sprung out and waving in the air like the blind feelers of some mechanical preying mantis and the eyes blinking on and off with chinese red pupils and tiny bambooblind eyelids going up and down and here comes the st marys chinese girls drum corps and here come sixteen white men in pith helmets beating big bass drums representing the order of the moose and here comes a gang of happy car salesmen disguised as islam shriners and here comes a chapter of the order of improved red men and here comes a cordon of motorcycle cops in crash helmets with radios going followed by a small papiermch lion fed with nekko wafers and run by two guys left over from a tenten festival which in turn is followed by the great chinese dragon itself gooking over balconies as it comes and the great chinese dragon has eaten a hundred humans and their legs pop out of his underside and are his walking legs which are not mentioned in the official printed program in which he is written up as the great golden dragon made in hong kong to the specifications of the chinese chamber of commerce and he represents the force and mystery of life and his head sways in the sky between the balconies as he comes followed by six chinese boy scouts wearing keds and carrying strings of batteries that light up the dragon like a nighttime freeway and he has lain all winter among a heap of collapsed paper lanterns and green rubber lizards and ivory backscratchers with the iron sidewalk doors closed over his head but he has now sprung up with the first sign of spring like the force of life itself and his head sways in the sky and gooks in green windows as he comes and he is a monster with the head of a dog and the body of a serpent risen yearly out of the sea to devour a virgin thrown from a cliff to appease him and he is a young man handsome and drunk ogling the girls and he has high ideals and a hundred sport shoes and he says no to mother and he is a big red table the world will never tilt and he has big eyes everywhere thru which he sees all womankind milkwhite and dovebreasted and he will eat their waterflowers for he is the cat with future feet wearing keds and he eats cake out of pastry windows and is hungrier and more potent and more powerful and more omnivorous than the papiermch lion run by the two guys and he is a great earthworm of lucky life filled with flowing chinese semen and he considers his own and our existence in its most profound sense as he comes and he has no christian answer to the existential question even as he sees the spiritual everywhere translucent in the material world and he does not want to escape the responsibility of being a dragon or the consequences of his long horny tail still buried in the basement but the blue citizens on their talking cycles think that he wants to escape and at all costs he must not be allowed to escape because the great chinese dragon is the greatest potential dragon in all the world and if allowed to escape from chinatown might gallop away up their new freeway at the broadway entrance mistaking it for a great wall of china or some other barbarian barrier and so go careening along it chewing up stanchions and signposts and belching forth some strange disintegrating medium which might melt down the great concrete walls of america and they are afraid of how far the great chinese dragon might really go starting from san francisco and so they have secretly and securely tied down the very end of his tail in its hole so that this great pulsing phallus of life at the very end of its parade at the very end of chinatown gives ones wild orgasm of a shudder and rolls over fainting in the bright night street since even for a dragon every orgasm is a little death and then the great chinese dragon starts silently shrinking and shriveling up and drawing back and back to its first cave and the soft silk skin wrinkles up and shrinks and shrinks on its sprung bamboo bones and the handsome dejected head hangs down like a defeated prizefighters and so is stuffed down again a last into its private place and the cellar sidewalk doors press down again over the great wilted head with one small hole of an eye blinking still thru the gratings of the metal doors as the great chinese dragon gives one last convulsive earthquake shake and rolls over deaddog to wait another white year for the final coming and the final sowing of his oats and teeth<|endoftext|>the pennycandystore beyond the el is where i first fell in love with unreality jellybeans glowed in the semigloom of that september afternoon a cat upon the counter moved

as if it had got his message even though it is poetry but most of the world wishing it could just forget about him and his awful strange prophecies along with all the other strange things he said about the world which were all too true and which made them fear him more than they loved him though he spoke much of love along with all the alarms he sounded which turned out to be false if only for the moment all of which made them fear his tongue more than they loved him though he spoke much of love and never lived by silence exile cunning and was a loud conscientious objector to the deaths we daily give each other though we speak much of love and when such a one dies even the agents of death should take note and shake the shit from their wings in air force one but they do not and the shit still flies and the poet now is disconnected and wont call back though he spoke much of love and still we hear him say do i not deal with angels when her lips i touch and still we hear him say my darling troubles heaven with her loveliness and still we hear him say as we are so wonderfully done with each other we can walk into our separate sleep on floors of music where the milkwhite cloak of childhood lies and still we hear him saying therefore the constant powers do not lessen nor is the property of the spirit scattered on the cold hills of these events and still we hear him asking do the dead know what time it is he is gone under he is scattered undersea and knows what time but wont be back to tell it he would be too proud to call back anyway and too full of strange laughter to speak to us anymore anyway and the weight of human experience lies upon the world like the chains of the sea in which he sings and he swings in the tides of the sea and his ashes are washed in the ides of the sea and an astonished eye looks out of the air to see the poet singing there and dusk falls down a coast somewhere where a white horse without a rider turns its head to the sea<|endoftext|>one grand boulevard with trees with one grand cafe in sun with strong black coffee in very small cups one not necessarily very beautiful man or woman who loves you one fine day

thought they had invented something that could make peace on earth if the wrong brothers didnt get hold of it when their wonderful flying machine took off at kitty hawk into the kingdom of birds but

his leather helmet and goggles hoping to sight the doves of peace but he did not even though he circled versailles and then the famous yankee clipper took off in the opposite direction and flew across the terrific pacific but the pacific doves were frighted by this strange amphibious bird and hid in the orient sky and then the famous flying fortress took off bristling with guns and testosterone to make the world safe for peace and capitalism but the birds of peace were nowhere to be found before or after hiroshima and so then clever men built bigger and faster flying machines and these great manmade birds with jet plumage flew higher than any real birds and seemed about to fly into the sun and melt their wings and like icarus crash to earth and the wright brothers were long forgotten in the highflying bombers that now began to visit their blessings on various third worlds all the while claiming they were searching for doves of peace and they kept flying and flying until they flew right into the st century and then one fine day a third world struck back and stormed the great planes and flew them straight into the beating heart of skyscraper america where there were no aviaries

and with grave chalk wing draw upon the leaded sky a thousand threaded images of flight it is the night that is their native habitat these spirit birds with bled white wings these droves of plover bearded eagles blind birds singing in glass fields these moonmad swans and ecstatic ganders trapped egrets charcoal owls trotting turtle symbols these pink fish among mountains shrikes seeking to nest whitebone drones mating in air among hallucinary moons and a masked bird fishing in a golden stream and an ibis feeding on its own breast and a stray connemara pooka life size and then those blown mute birds bearing fish and paper messages between two streams which are the twin streams of oblivion wherein the imagination turning upon itself with white electric vision refinds itself still mad

the page in a veritable rage of adversity heaped up groaning with babies and bayonets under cement skies in an abstract landscape of blasted trees bent statues bats wings and beaks slippery gibbets cadavers and carnivorous cocks and all the final hollering monsters of the imagination of disaster they are so bloody real it is as if they really still existed and they do only the landscape is changed they still are ranged along the roads plagued by legionnaires false windmills and demented roosters they are the same people only further from home on freeways fifty lanes wide on a concrete continent spaced with bland billboards illustrating imbecile illusions of happiness the scene shows fewer tumbrils but more strungout citizens in painted cars and they have strange license plates and engines that devour america<|endoftext|>crossfigured creeping with trams and the artists on sundays in the summer all tracking nature in the suburbs it could have been anyplace but it wasnt it was london and when someone shouted over that they had got a model i ran out across the court but then when the model started taking off her clothes there was nothing underneath i mean to say she took off her shoes and found no feet took off her top and found no tit under it and i must say she did look a bit astounded just standing there looking down at where her legs were not but so very carefully then she put her clothes back on and as soon as she was dressed again completely she was completely all right do it again cried someone rushing for his easel but she was afraid to and gave up modelling and forever after slept in her clothes<|endoftext|>the text of this poem could not be published because of copyright laws<|endoftext|>you do not do you do not do any more black shoe in which

wilderness of green heartshaped leaves like catalpa leaves and lillies of monstrous size like no wellbred lilies it seems teh consistent critics wanted you to choose between your world of jungle green and the fashionable monde of the red couch with its prim bricbrac without a moon to turn you luminous without the eye of tigers to be stilled by your dark eye and body whiter than its frill of lilies theyd have had yellow silk screening the moon leaves and lilies flattened to paper behind you or at most to a millefleurs tapestry but the couch stood stubborn in its jungle red against green red against fifty variants of green the couch glared out at the prosaic eye so rousseau to explain why the red couch persisted in the picture with the lilies tigers snakes and the snakecharmer and you and birds of paradise and the round moon described how you fell dreaming at full of moon on a red velvet couch within your green tessellared boudoir hearing flutes you dreamed yourself away in the moons eye to a beryl jungle and dreamed that bright moonlilies nodded their petaled heads around your couch and that rousseau told the critics was why the couch accompanied you so they nodded at the couch with the moon and the snakecharmers song and the gigantic lilies marvelingly numbered the many shades of green but to a friend in private rousseau confessed his eye so possessed by the glowing red of the couch which you yadwigha pose on that he put you on the couch to feed his eye with red such red under the moon in the midst of all that green and those great lilies<|endoftext|>i made a fire being tired of the white fists of old letters and their death rattle when i came too close to the wastebasket what did they know that i didnt grain by grain they unrolled sands where a dream of clear water grinned like a getaway car i am not subtle love love and well i was tired of cardboard cartons the color of cement or a dog pack holding in its hate dully under a pack of men in red jackets and the eyes and times of the postmarks this fire may lick and fawn but it is merciless a glass case my fingers would enter although they melt and sag they are told do not touch and here is an end to the writing the spry hooks that bend and cringe and the smiles the smiles and at least it will be a good place now the attic at least i wont be strung just under the surface dumb fish with one tin eye watching for glints riding my arctic between this wish and that wish so i poke at the carbon birds in my housedress they are more beautiful than my bodiless owl they console me rising and flying but
